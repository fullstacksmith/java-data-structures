## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with the exercises, clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Exercises-on-Data-Structures.git
cd Exercises-on-Data-Structures

You can implement the exercises in your preferred language (Java, Python, C++, etc.). However, Java is the primary language used in this repository.

### 📚 Data Structures

Each section includes an exercise for implementation and analysis:

#### Arrays

* Insert n random numbers.

* Search for a number and return its index.

* Remove a number and shift elements.

* Find the second-largest number.

### Stack

* Implement a stack using an array or linked list.

* Support push(), pop(), peek(), and isEmpty() operations.

* Extra: Implement getMin() in O(1).

## Queue

* Implement a queue using a linked list.

* Support enqueue(), dequeue(), peek(), and isEmpty().

* Extra: Implement a circular queue.

### Linked List

* Singly Linked List: Insert, delete, search, and reverse.

* Doubly Linked List: Implement efficient head/tail insertion and deletion.

* Skip List: Implement a basic Skip List with search and insert operations.

### Hash Table

* Implement a hash table with chaining for collision resolution.

* Support put(), get(), and remove().

* Extra: Implement rehashing when the table is full.

### Binary Search Tree (BST)

* Implement insert(), search(), and delete().

* Perform in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals.

* Extra: Find the k-th smallest element.

### Advanced Trees

* AVL Tree: Implement rotations (LL, RR, LR, RL) and self-balancing.

* Red-Black Tree: Implement insertion and ensure balancing.

* B-Tree: Implement a B-Tree with t = 3.

### Graphs

Implement BFS (Breadth-First Search) and DFS (Depth-First Search).

Implement Dijkstra’s Algorithm for shortest path calculation.

## 🔢 Sorting Algorithms

* Implement QuickSort, MergeSort, and HeapSort.

* Optimize Bubble Sort to detect sorted arrays.

* Implement Radix Sort and Counting Sort.

* Create a hybrid Insertion Sort + MergeSort (Timsort).

## 📊 Complexity Analysis

* Each exercise includes a complexity analysis for:

* Time Complexity (Best, Average, Worst Case)

* Space Complexity
